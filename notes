If I mmap a gigabyte I see these:
> VM_ALLOCATE                      128.0M       4K       4K       0K       0K       0K       0K        1
> VM_ALLOCATE (reserved)           825.7M       0K       0K       0K       0K       0K       0K        1         reserved VM address space (unallocated)

And that's gone again after a mmunmap
